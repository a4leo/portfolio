                <p>
                    The ‚ÄòCoral & Marina‚Äô Hotel is one of the main hotels in Ensenada,
                    big part of the tourism that arrives <br> in the city decides to stay here,
                    but currently there has been a growth in the hotel business.<br><br>

                    Therefore, as a company it has been decided to develop and 
                    implement an application to <br> give visibility to the hotel,
                    in the same way it was decided to create a dashboard is required 
                    to easily <br> manage the mobile application. <br><br>

                    The application developed for this company offers a clean and clear
                    management for hotel staff.<br> The hotel now has the ability to
                    manually record who will be staff in charge of the position to control <br>
                    the application and likewise monitor, edit and preview the content
                    that will be given to users.<br>

                    <p>
                        The first step was planning the interaction between the dashboard with the app.
                        We need it to think like <br> our client and see what were the changes that they would 
                        want to do inside the dashboard and how this  <br> changes would be seeing inside the app.
                        <br><br>
                        We made this part the most important in our meetings with our clients. With the help of everybody involved,<br>
                        we were able to create a good start for the project.

                        <p>
                            With the wireframes finally approved, 
                            we were able to explore and have fun with the most creativity part of<br> the project, 
                            giving our best to create and appealing look but still respecting the guidelines of the company.

                                <p>
                                    The app was meant for a different public, it was no longer only for our client -the crew of the hotel- but also <br> 
                                    for the customers of the hotel. It need to have an easy and friendly use for the user so we decide that it need <br>to have the flow of what most people use know days, a social media app.
